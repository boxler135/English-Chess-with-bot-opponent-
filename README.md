Attempting to build a chess game with bot to play against

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Chess AI bot that can play against human opponents. The AI will be designed to understand and play chess at various levels of difficulty, providing a challenging and enjoyable experience for players of all skill levels. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, the goal is to create an AI that can not only make strategic moves but also adapt its gameplay based on the opponent's moves. This project relies heavily on the library `pygame`, where the documentation can be found [here](https://pygame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_intro/intro.html)

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to delve into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and game theory. Chess, with its complex strategies and deep history, provides an excellent platform to explore AI development. This project will serve as a practical exercise to enhance my skills in algorithm design, machine learning, and AI, while also creating something fun and engaging. Being the first end to end project that I will be working on alone I am excited to embark on this journey.
